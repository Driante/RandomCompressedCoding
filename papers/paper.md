# Coding properties of Random Manifolds

## V1 From Data 

- Introduction
  - Sensory layer with localized tuning curves. E.g. DS cells, place cells, ecc... Embed low dimensional variable into high dimensional representation.
  - Information must be transmitted to another region, maybe with less neurons. Evidence for more complex tuning properties in cortex. How to transmit this data? Avoid complex synaptic tuning -> random projection. Lalazar and Abbot modelMotivated by compressed sensing.
  - Intrinsic difference between localized tuning curves and multipeaked one- > ambiguity. grid cells and Fig.1 (phase space)
  - Random feedforward network 
- Global and local error
  - Random Feedforward network. Motivation for various assumptions
  - Error histogram, global and local errors, balance local-global error
- Extension to multiple dimensions
  - Data analysis
- Decoders
  - Hebbian Learning on simplest decoder (network implementation of MMSE)?
- Discussion
  - Connect to Random Manifolds
  - Mixed Sleectivity
